			<p>The Glaucus Atlanticus uses countershading. The blue side of their body faces upwards towards the sky, blending with the blue of the water.
				Underneath they have a silver or grey side that faces downwards, blending in with the sunlight when viewed upwards from underwater.
				These creatures are pelagic, meaning they float upside down by using the surface tension of the water.
				Humans handling the slug may receive a very painful and potentially dangerous sting.</p>
